Objects Detection

Project Description

Objects Detection is a Python-based project that utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning frameworks to detect and recognize objects in real-time or from static images. The project leverages YOLO and MediaPipe libraries for efficient and accurate detection. It includes:

Object Detection using YOLO

OCR functionality using PyTesseract

Hand Drawing Features using MediaPipe

Face Detection: Training code for face detection using deep learning frameworks

Demo for Trained Models: Implementation of a demo script for running inference with the generated model from the training process

Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up your development environment and get started with the project:

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python.org.

Installation Steps

Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

Install OpenCV for image processing:

pip install opencv-python

Install PyTorch for deep learning:

pip install torch

Install TorchVision for image transformations:

pip install torchvision

Install TorchAudio for audio processing (optional):

pip install torchaudio

Install NumPy for numerical computations:

pip install numpy

Install Tkinter for GUI (optional):

pip install tkinter

Install MediaPipe for hand and object detection:

pip install mediapipe

Install YOLO for object detection:

pip install yolo

Install the Ultralytics package for YOLO:

pip install ultralytics

Install CVZone for image processing utilities:

pip install cvzone

Install PyTesseract for OCR functionality:

pip install pytesseract

Usage

After setting up your environment, you can run the project scripts to detect objects. Ensure that your input data (images or videos) is accessible and properly configured for the detection pipeline.
