# Objects Detection

## Project Description
Objects Detection is a Python-based project that utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning frameworks to detect and recognize objects in real-time or from static images. The project leverages YOLO and MediaPipe libraries for efficient and accurate detection. It includes:

- **Object Detection** using YOLO
- **OCR** functionality using PyTesseract
- **Hand Drawing Features** using MediaPipe
- **Face Detection**: Training code for face detection using deep learning frameworks
- **Demo for Trained Models**: Implementation of a demo script for running inference with the generated model from the training process

## Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up your development environment and get started with the project:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation Steps
Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

1. Install OpenCV for image processing:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. Install PyTorch for deep learning:
   ```bash
   pip install torch
   ```

3. Install TorchVision for image transformations:
   ```bash
   pip install torchvision
   ```

4. Install TorchAudio for audio processing (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install torchaudio
   ```

5. Install NumPy for numerical computations:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

6. Install Tkinter for GUI (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

7. Install MediaPipe for hand and object detection:
   ```bash
   pip install mediapipe
   ```

8. Install YOLO for object detection:
   ```bash
   pip install yolo
   ```

9. Install the Ultralytics package for YOLO:
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
   ```

10. Install CVZone for image processing utilities:
    ```bash
    pip install cvzone
    ```

11. Install PyTesseract for OCR functionality:
    ```bash
    pip install pytesseract
    ```

## Usage
After setting up your environment, you can run the project scripts to detect objects. Ensure that your input data (images or videos) is accessible and properly configured for the detection pipeline.
